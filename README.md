- 👋 Hi, I’m @caw7
- 👀 I’m interested in application and games development as well as many, many other things.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python3, Java, and AWS services (the free ones, heh).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any quality of life improvement applications that are open source. Or online games projects. That would be fun.
- 📫 How to reach me: (secure URL intro).linkedin.(cam with an o)/in/cameron-caw7/

- If anyone is (by some crazy coincidence) interested/knowledgable in reverse-engineering old sega games, please please show me how.
- An IT life goal of mine is to translate the Japanese originals of the Uncharted Waters' games into English - Daikoukai Jidai III (1996 onwards).
- This is the closest link I've found to a project I'm referring to: http://www.unchartedwatersnewhorizons.com/forum/new-forum-group1/general-forum1/daikoukai-jidai-gaiden-with-english-translation-thread449.0/#postid-2788
